As you probably already know, **Ti.Forward** is a community-born effort to
investigate what the future will look like for the Appcelerator® Titanium™ SDK,
and probably to **carve a little bit of it** in the process.

As our **manifesto** goes, we want to guide us all into a more empowered
community, one **able to contribute value back to Appcelerator®**.

There are already some [great discussion in place][discuss] and I suggest you
all to have a look at them and contribute your whishes and ideas.

[discuss]: https://github.com/TiForward/discuss/issues

If a more direct and fast discussion is more your style there’s also [a
pretty active Gitter chat][gitter] where we can discuss opinions as a
community.

But while GitHub issues and chatrooms are good to discuss things, they’re not
that great when it comes down **to update people on the state of the project**.

That’s why I’m pleased to announce this little thing called **the Journal**,
where we’ll publish all the relevant updates and milestones.

I’ll close this first, introductory article with a stolen quote, one I’m in
love with since the first time I saw it:

> Be humble
